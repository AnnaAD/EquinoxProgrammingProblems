# Equinox Programming Problems

These were programming problems for the equinox programming challenge. The write-up for each problem as well as the online platofrm used to host the competition can be seen here: https://www.hackerrank.com/equinox-programming-challenge.

These are the solutions we implemented in Java as well as the test cases and some workflow code. Feel free to look at this as help for organizing your own competition!
